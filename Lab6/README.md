1.	Write a program that reads 10 binary numbers from Port 0, save it in internal RAM location 40H to 49H. Then calculate the sum of the ten numbers and save it in the internal RAM location start at 4AH (low goes to 4AH, high byte goes to 4BH, etc). When testing the program, set a breakpoint on the instruction that reads Port 0 so that you can set different values for each read. Make sure to use direct addressing mode and register indirect addressing mode in your program. Screen shot the final results in internal RAM location 40H to 4AH. 

2.	Use indexed addressing mode and DPTR for the following assignment: Implement the following double bouncing LED display using a lookup table: •??????•,?•????•?, ??•??•??, ???••???, ??•??•??, ?•????•?, and then repeat. Please demonstrate the program to the instructor.
